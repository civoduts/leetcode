# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** problems, implemented in **Python**.  
It’s a structured collection intended for problem-solving, code review and pattern recognition practice.

Each problem lives in its own numbered folder under the `problems/` directory, with multiple `solution.py` files containing a clean and minimal implementation.
